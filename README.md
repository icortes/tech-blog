# Tech Blog

This app is a CMS-style blog site that people can publish their blog posts and comment on other's posts as well. This app follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) paradigm in its architectural structure. It is using [Handlebars.js](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/) as the template language, [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/master/index.html) as the [ORM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object%E2%80%93relational_mapping) (Object-Relational Mapping), and [express-session](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session) npm package for authentication.
